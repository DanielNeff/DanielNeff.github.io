<p><font size="5" color="black">I am a freshman at <a href="http://www.bju.edu/">Bob Jones University</a> currently studying computer science.
The reason for my major was fueled by my experience with technology at my home church <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tabernaclebaptist.church.39/">Tabernacle Baptist Church</a>.
And since I have ran the media program there for severeal years it was quite easy for me to choose programming as my major.
I intend to apply for a intership after graduating from college and possibly starting my own buisness.
But for now I will see where the Lord will take me.<br/>


<p>In my free time at the college I enjoy socializing with others on campus. I try to awalys expand the list of people I know and friends I make.
 While staying active in the gym or playing sports, particularly football and basketball. Even though I am currently only a decent basketball player 
 I strive to become better to maybe one day play on the bruins.<br/></p>
 <p>
 While this new adventure in my life is foreign to me I know that I have others back home praying for me to succeed. 
 If God wanted me here He can surely get me through this. I live by God's word and know that His promises will hold true.</br></p>
 
 Matthew 7:7-8 <p><i>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</i></p>
